## SEAT BOOKING PROJECT 
In this project, we'll work with bidimensional arrays. We'll implement the funcionality of a movie theater by allowing customers to book, consult and cancel. We'll have 3 layers (presentation, model and service). In this case we'll not have a repository layer since we'll not keep any information, this is a very simple project.

It can be improved by making the bookings a class and having a repository to keep them and being able to consult them, but that can be for a later project or improvement of this project.
